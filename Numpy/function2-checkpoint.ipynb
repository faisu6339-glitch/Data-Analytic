    "> Using functions to build other functions is a great way to reuse code and implement complex business logic while still keeping the code small, understandable, and manageable. Ideally, a function should do one thing and one thing only. If you find yourself writing a function that does too many things, consider splitting it into multiple smaller, independent functions. As a rule of thumb, try to limit your functions to 10 lines of code or less. Good programmers always write short, simple, and readable functions.\n"
